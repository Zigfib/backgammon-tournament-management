### 4. Tournament Systems Explained

#### Swiss Tournament System
Swiss tournaments use an advanced pairing algorithm that:
- **Pairs players with similar scores** within the tolerance range
- **Avoids repeat pairings** when possible
- **Uses scenario enumeration** to ensure all players can eventually be paired
- **Provides safe pairings** only when all outcomes allow future pairing

**Swiss Tiebreakers** (in order):
1. **Points** (3 for win, 1 for loss)
2. **Head-to-Head (TB1)**: Direct results between tied players
3. **Buchholz (TB2)**: Sum of all opponents' final points
4. **Goal Difference**: Total point differential

#### Round-Robin System
Traditional format where every player plays every other player the specified number of rounds.

#### Ranking Systems

**Standard Ranking**
Ranks players by:
1. **Total Points** (3 points for win, 1 for loss)
2. **Wins vs Same Points** (head-to-head against tied players)
3. **Buchholz Score** (sum of all opponents' points)
4. **Goal Difference** (total point differential)

**Hybrid Ranking**
Alternating system:
- **Positions 1-2**: Ranked by points + tiebreakers
- **Positions 3-4**: Ranked by ELO improvement + tiebreakers
- **Pattern continues**: 5-6 by points, 7-8 by ELO, etc.

### 5. Score Entry Modes

- **Admin Only**: Only users in admin mode can enter scores
- **Player Entry**: Any player can enter scores for matches they're involved in
- **Dual Confirm**: Both players must enter matching scores for confirmation
